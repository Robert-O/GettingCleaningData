This project serves as a way to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Developing


## Building
If you would like to run the source code on your local machine, the following mods may needs to be made:
-  the source code currently uses a working directory of '~Rworkspace/Course_3/Peer assignment'.  If using a different working directory, this may need to be changed.
-  the folder structure within the '~/Peer assignment' contains the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder as it is in the zip file.  Again, if not using this file structure, the statements that read from the train and test folders.
